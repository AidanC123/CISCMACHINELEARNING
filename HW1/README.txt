Just a simple explanation of the two .ipynb files
The hw1.ipynb file is the one I know works on Google Colab (which is what I used to complete this assignment).
The hw1Adapt.ipynb file is the one I believe works on Anaconda 
The only difference between the two is the way the files are loaded with the 
numbers = pd.read_csv('Real estate.csv', sep=',').to_numpy()[:,1:] 
line which I had to change to work on Google Colab
Note; I dont have 10, 11, 12, or 13, I realized they existed too late
